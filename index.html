<h1 style="font-size:400%;">ALERT DEVICE</h1>
<p>This a project started by NISH Trivandrum for helping the speech and hearing impaired people. This device is to be used in the library.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-size:2vw">WEEK 1:</li>

<ul>
<li>Components required to design the circuit were identified and listed.</li>
<li>A block diagram of the circuit was drawn.</li>
<li>Some circuits were done for study purpose</li>
<li>We also fixed a timeline according to which the project was to be completed.</li>

<p>A basic stage of the circuit was made and temporarily fixed onto a breadboard.</P>

</ul>

<li style="font-size:2vw">WEEK 2:</li>
<ul>
<li>The project was implemented using NodeMCU</li>
<li>Using MIT appinventor, an app was created.</li>
<li>Fabricated the power supply and regulator sytem.</li>
<li>Measurements were taken for making CAD design.</li>
<li>Different trials were carried out for CAD design, and finally fixed a model based on aesthetics and ergonomics.</li>
</ul>
